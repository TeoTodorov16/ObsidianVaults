Explain very good with examples what API is.

Section 13 - 148


# **API**

Application Programming Interface

Official Definition:

<mark class="hltr-cyan">An</mark> <mark class="hltr-grey">Application Programming Interface</mark> <mark class="hltr-cyan">(API) is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to</mark> <mark class="hltr-blue">create software or interact with an external system.</mark>

API's can be used to create software or to Interact with an external system

<mark class="hltr-cyan">It provides developers with</mark> <mark class="hltr-blue">standard commands for performing common operations</mark> <mark class="hltr-cyan">so they do not have to write the code from scratch.</mark>


<mark class="hltr-red">There are also API's which are used to interact with an external system.</mark>

So, for example, if you've ever seen in the Tinder app where they have this section called Shared Friends or Shared Interests, where do they get this data from.

Using the API from Facebook the AI gets to know you better and what are you preferences or find people you have already met.

So effectively, you can consider an API as simply just a contract.
It's the contract between the developer and the API provider.
