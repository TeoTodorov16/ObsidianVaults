So essentially, this is the syntax for a closure.

You have the parentheses that surround the input parameters.

You have the dash and angle brackets that specify the return type, and the "<mark class="hltr-red">in</mark>" keyword symbolize the beginning of your closure body.

So this is the functionality that my closure is going to perform and everything is contained inside these curly braces. And the closure doesn't have a name or a funky word and you can recognize it by this syntax.
