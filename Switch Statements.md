So here is a normal <mark class="hltr-red">Conditional Statements</mark>  ==>

So now there is an Alternative way.
It's called a <mark class="hltr-orange">Swift Switch Statement</mark>
==>

It's pretty simple.
You write a switch statement pointing to the constant (<mark class="hltr-grey">in my case hardness</mark>) and then you provide cases in which something is getting executed.


Now as a good practice you can usually make the <mark class="hltr-pink">default</mark> catch exceptions.
So then the code will look like this  -->

What is different is that I added one more case which include the Hardness and on the default I let catch an exception with an <mark class="hltr-red">"Error"</mark> message.
