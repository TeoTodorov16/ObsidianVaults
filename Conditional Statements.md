Now this is a crucial key skill when <mark class="hltr-yellow">Programming/Coding</mark> ðŸ”‘ 
It's Called the <mark class="hltr-red">Conditional Statements</mark>

Test:

It's very simple.
If the traffic light shows <mark class="hltr-green">green </mark> light then function <mark class="hltr-pink">go()</mark> starts / if it doesn't show green then the else statement starts with it's function <mark class="hltr-purple">stop()</mark>

But there is something else ...
What if there is another condition ?
Usually on a traffic light there are <mark class="hltr-red">3 </mark><mark class="hltr-orange">lights</mark> <mark class="hltr-green">-></mark>

Now how the new sniped code will look like if there is another statement?

We have now a 3rd condition. 

Now we say: If it is <mark class="hltr-green">green</mark> then <mark class="hltr-green">go</mark>, <mark class="hltr-pink">else if</mark> the traffic light  is = <mark class="hltr-orange">amber</mark> light  (<mark class="hltr-pink">another condition</mark>), then in that case use <mark class="hltr-orange">your judgement</mark> here and the final <mark class="hltr-pink">else</mark> is if all of those are not true then we are going to <mark class="hltr-red">stop</mark>.



There is another type of Statements which are useful in <mark class="hltr-grey">iOS programming</mark>.
It's called <mark class="hltr-red">Switch Statements</mark>
