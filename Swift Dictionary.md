In Swift - Dictionary is another <mark class="hltr-red">Collection Data Type</mark>
Just like <mark class="hltr-orange">Arrays</mark> 

Test:

Here I created a variable called dict (for dictionary) and set it to equal a collection.

<mark class="hltr-red">Reminder!</mark>
All collections in Swift start and end with <mark class="hltr-green">[ ]</mark>


Now in the Swift Dictionary we have a <mark class="hltr-purple">Key Value Pair</mark>

Where <mark class="hltr-red">Key</mark> is simply the item we can look up (say the words in the dictionary) and the <mark class="hltr-orange">Value</mark> is the accompanying piece.

You are not limited to single entry per dictionary, you can have as many as you want.

Now something else to specify is that in my dictionary my key and my value have the same datatype - String (they are both strings, pice of texts)

But you can mix it up =>

Here I have a <mark class="hltr-red">String</mark> as the <mark class="hltr-red">Key</mark> and an <mark class="hltr-orange">Integer</mark> as the <mark class="hltr-orange">Value</mark>

For example you can create a phonebook dictionary where you store your friends names and their numbers stored in separate key value pairs.

In the example above I specify a datatype using the column and then I say this is going to be a collection type (putting the [  ] ) and the key to the first item is going to be <mark class="hltr-red">String</mark> data type and the second item is going to be <mark class="hltr-orange">Integer</mark> data type.

I can stuff as many of these key-value pairs into my dictionary as I want as long as I stick to the datatype specified by me.

Or how to retrieve rive an item out of my dictionary?

Retrieving from the Dictionary

Which will give me a value of <mark class="hltr-yellow">812331248</mark>
