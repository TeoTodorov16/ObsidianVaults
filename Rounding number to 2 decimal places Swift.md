1. `String(format: "%.2f", sender.value)`: This part creates a formatted string using the `String(format:)` initializer. The format specifier `"%.2f"` is used to format a floating-point number (`f`) with two decimal places (`.2`). It essentially converts the `sender.value` (which is assumed to be a `Float` or `Double`) into a string with two decimal places.
    
2. `print(...)`: This function is used to print the formatted string to the console.
    

So, when you execute this line of code with `sender.value` equal to `3.14159` (for example), it formats the value to have two decimal places and prints the result:

In this case, the output will be the string `"3.14"` because it rounds the number to two decimal places.
